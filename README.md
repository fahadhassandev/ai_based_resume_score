I'll help you create a comprehensive plan for your Task Management System. Let me break this down into structured sections.

# Project Plan: Task Management System

## 1. Overall Approach

### Project Structure
- Create a Django project with the following main apps:
  - `accounts`: User authentication and management
  - `projects`: Project-related functionality
  - `tasks`: Task management and tracking
  - `dashboard`: Analytics and overview features

### Architecture
- Follow Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture
- Implement REST API endpoints using Django REST Framework
- Use JWT for secure authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py

└── dashboard/

## 2. Data/Resource Setup

### Database Schema
1. Users & Authentication
   - User model (extending Django's built-in User)
   - Role model (Admin, Project Manager, Team Member)
   - UserProfile model (additional user information)

2. Projects
   - Project model (name, description, start_date, end_date, status)
   - ProjectMember model (project-user relationships)

3. Tasks
   - Task model (title, description, priority, status, due_date)
   - TaskAssignment model (task-user relationships)
   - TaskComment model
   - TaskAttachment model
   - TaskHistory model (for tracking changes)

## 3. Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Setup & Authentication
1. Initialize Django project
2. Configure JWT authentication
3. Implement user registration and login
4. Set up role-based permissions
5. Create user profile management

### Phase 2: Project Management
1. Implement project CRUD operations
2. Create project member management
3. Set up project permissions
4. Add project analytics features

### Phase 3: Task Management
1. Implement task CRUD operations
2. Create task assignment system
3. Add priority and status management
4. Implement file attachment system
5. Create comment system
6. Set up task history tracking

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics
1. Create main dashboard view
2. Implement task filtering and sorting
3. Add project progress tracking
4. Create analytics visualizations
5. Implement search functionality

## 4. Testing & Validation Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test models and their relationships
- Validate business logic
- Test authentication and permissions
- Verify CRUD operations

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints
- Validate user workflows
- Test file upload/download
- Verify email notifications

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test user interface flows
- Verify role-based access
- Test dashboard functionality
- Validate reporting features

## 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Authentication & Authorization
- Handle expired JWT tokens
- Manage concurrent sessions
- Handle unauthorized access attempts

### Data Validation
- Validate date ranges (start date < end date)
- Handle duplicate project/task names
- Validate file types and sizes
- Handle missing required fields

### Task Management
- Handle task reassignment
- Manage task dependencies
- Handle overdue tasks
- Manage task status transitions

### Project Management
- Handle project archival
- Manage team member removal
- Handle project deletion with existing tasks

## 6. Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting
- Sanitize user inputs
- Secure file uploads
- Implement audit logging
- Handle sensitive data encryption

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Implement database indexing
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets

This plan provides a structured approach to building your task management system. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or move forward with implementing a particular phase?
